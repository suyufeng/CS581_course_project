The simplest way of its compile is to type `make'.

The `Makefile' basically assumes that you use the programs:
	  (i) GNU make,
	 (ii) GNU g++, and
	(iii) GNU sed (if you want to use an older g++).
These programs are required for generating source file
dependency information. Therefore, even if you do not
use GNU make, you can use `Makefile' with target `binary'; 
`make binary' also generates the `prime' binary.

If you use a compiler such as icc or older g++
you may have to add the `-DCLIMITS' option to `CXXFLAGS'.
For details, see `Makefile'.

After compile, copy `prime' into your favorite directory.
In addition, it would also be convinient to copy `gap'
(that specifies gap cost parameters), and substitution matrix
into the same directory.
